# Route Optimization using Graph Theory

## Overview

This project models a smart transportation network using Graph Theory concepts. A synthetic network of 500 cities is represented as a weighted undirected graph, where cities are vertices and roads are weighted edges representing distances.

The objective is to analyze network connectivity, detect clusters of connected cities, and determine optimal routes using classical graph algorithms.
